Bwock for Linux
==========================================================

Running
-------

For a quick check to see if you're missing any libraries 
needed to run Bwock, run the bash file from a terminal as so:

./bwock

Any missing dependancies will be listed. You may already have
them all if you've done much else on this system.

Mostly, debian packages match up with any libraries which are
missing, so use apt-get if you can. Once you have this sorted, 
the above command should launch the application. Furthermore, 
just clicking on the "bwock" file in a browser should start it 
as well.




How To Play
-----------

Enter:        Start
Arrow Keys:   Control Bwock
Space:        Land (if flying)
Backspace:    Reset current level
Escape:       Quit
'M' Key:      Toggle music on and off
'S' Key:      Toggle sound on and off
CTRL-C:	      Level Skip ( Temporary )

The goal of each level is to collect every key while staying alive.
Avoid walking into direct view of the Wizrats, as they'll shoot you 
where you stand. The walls of the hedge maze will not protect you from 
this, but boulders and brick walls certainly will. If you see a spring, 
touch it to launch into the air, and press space to land wherever you 
like - you're invincible if you're airborne!
