Bwock for Windows
==========================================================

Running
-------

To begin the game, just run the executable called "Bwock.exe" from the 
folder it came in. It should begin immediately.



How To Play
-----------

Enter:        Start
Arrow Keys:   Control Bwock
Space:        Land (if flying)
Backspace:    Reset current level
Escape:       Quit
'M' Key:      Toggle music on and off
'S' Key:      Toggle sound on and off
CTRL-C:	      Level Skip ( Temporary )

The goal of each level is to collect every key while staying alive.
Avoid walking into direct view of the Wizrats, as they'll shoot you 
where you stand. The walls of the hedge maze will not protect you from 
this, but boulders and brick walls certainly will. If you see a spring, 
touch it to launch into the air, and press space to land wherever you 
like - you're invincible if you're airborne!
